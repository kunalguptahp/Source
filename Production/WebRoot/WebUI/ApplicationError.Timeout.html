	NOTE: This error can occur repeatedly for specific slow or long-running operations, and can also occur intermittently or randomly as a result of any user action (e.g. due to temporary high server load or server unavailability).
	<br />
	If possible, please wait a while and then attempt to perform the operation again. Timeouts caused by high server load will frequently succeed if the operation is repeated at a later time.
	<br />
	However, if the same operation consistently results in a timeout, even after multiple attempts at different times, then successfully completing operation may require administrator assistance.
	Please document the exact steps you were attempting to perform, and contact an ElementsCPS Administrator for assistance.
